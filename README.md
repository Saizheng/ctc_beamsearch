This is a python implementation of Alex grave's paper "Towards End-to-End Speech Recognition
with Recurrent Neural Networks", http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/graves14.pdf.

*Note: The code is slighly inefficient, but it's a simple straightforward implementation, and a good place to start.*
